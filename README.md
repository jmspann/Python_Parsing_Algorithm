<h1>Create a Parsing Alorithm Using Python</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
An important part of cybersecurity is controlling access to restricted content. In this lab, you'll work with a text file containing IP addresses that are allowed to access specific restricted content at your organization. <br/>
<br />
Parsing a file allows security analysts to read and update the contents. Python helps analysts develop algorithms to automate the process of parsing files and keeping them up-to-date. <br/>
<br />
You'll develop an algorithm that parses this text file of IP addresses and updates the file by removing that addresses that no longer have access to the restricted content.
<br />

<h2>Scenario</h2>
In this lab, you're working as a security analyst and you're responsible for developing an algorithm that parses a file containing IP addresses that are allowed to access restricted content and removes addresses that no longer have access.
